Installing bazel on Ubuntu:
  https://docs.bazel.build/versions/2.0.0/install-ubuntu.html

Your project files are in src/main/java/**

To build project:
  bazel build ...

To run project:
  bazel run //src/main/java:JudgeDemo
    OR
  I have also included a build script to make it quicker to run. It's literally
  just the above command. In order to run it, you need to give it permission
  with `chmod 777 run.sh`. Then whenever you make an edit to your code and want
  to run it, just type `./run.sh`

  Let me know if you have any questions. I am aware I mixed up your file 
  structure.

To test project (in future, to be implemented):
  bazel test ...
